-> Object Orientation is the perspective of looking at this world around us as what a collection of objects
-> For the creation of our custom date we need to pass the constructor parameter as Date(year, month, date, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds) and passing a string representation is also valid like "2024-1-23T:12:23:56Z",here Z represents the UTC time.
-> JavaScript is Single Threaded Language.
-> A Thread can do One Task at a time.
-> Some JavaScript engines are V8,Chakra,
-> Browser's JavaScript runtime  = JavaScript Engine + Web API's + Event Loop's.
-> Node JS JavaScript runtime  = JavaScript Engine + Node JS API's + Even Loop's.
-> All the loop's in JS are Synchronous.
-> JavaScript Engine only blocks the sync and async
-> Sync Blocking 
-> Sync Non-Blocking
-> Async Non-Blocking
-> Async Blocking
-> setTimeout() = ({},timeout) and setInterval() = ({},timeout) these two functions acts as the Async Behaviour.
-> The use of setInterval() is it executes the callback function for n times in the given timeout.
-> Backend consists of 3 layers they are HTTP server, APIs, Database.
-> The role of HTTP server is it receives the request form the client and send it to the API. The HTTP server cannot handle the client request.
-> The role of the APIs is to handle the client request
-> The protocol established between the API and the Database is Database Protocol.it depends on the name of the Database
-> The use of express.js is it will create the both HTTP server and as well as APIs at the same time

Backend Setup Steps
--------------------
1) Generate the package.json file 
		 npm init -y
2) Create HTTP Server
		a. Install & import "express" module
				npm install express
		b. Import the express module
